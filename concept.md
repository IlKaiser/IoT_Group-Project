# Concept

## Introduction

Safety Floater is a project born to satisfy Blue Growth requirements for coastal tourism, in particular the monitoring and security of territory.
The goal is to detect the illegal transit of boats near by swimmers, in order to preserve the safe distance. This system allows to the authorities to monitor coasts and tourists' welfare. At the same time, Safety Floater allows to achieve another goal in an indirect way: improve the water pollution near the coast.
So the system has two principal type of users: tourists and coast guards.

## Tourists

This is the first type of user the application is directed to. The main purpose is to preserve the safety of swimmers.
Below we propose two personas that represent this category.

As we can see from the above persona, Bob cares a lot about his family security, and with Safety Floater he feels more secure when his children go swim to the sea.
Also, he can enjoy his vacation, because he can relax and trust the local authorities efficiency.

As we can see from the above persona, Vittoria cares a lot about the environment, and with Safety Floater she is confident about the pollution of water caused by boats very close to the coast. So, she can have fun at sea without any worries, such as be hit by a boat while she is swimming.
