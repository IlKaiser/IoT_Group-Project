# Second delivery

## Comments from first delivery
- There is the needing to distinguish between relevant and non-relevant problems for our project
- Studying sensors' performances in variuos situations, e.g. ultrasonic proximity sensor with temperature and humidity
- Lora-WAN antenna dimensioning and positioning (how does the sea movement affects the performances of Lora-WAN protocol?)
- How to solve the problem of detecting false positives that could derive from our solution
- On Iot-lab, we need to develop a testing plan
